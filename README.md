# DCReconNetï¼šDistortion-Corrected Image Reconstruction with Deep Learning on an MRI-Linac
Authors: Shanshan Shan

This repository contains the implementation of DCReconNet for distortion-corrected image reconstruction using Pytorch-gpu. For a quick test, the trained weights can be used. The folder Test_data contains 300 testing brain data and each data incudes the undersampled k-space, unersampling mask and distorted k-space trajectory.

The architecture of the DCReconNet:
